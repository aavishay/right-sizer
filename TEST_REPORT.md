# Test Report: CRD Field Validation Fix

## Test Date
August 30, 2025

## Test Environment
- **Platform**: macOS
- **Kubernetes**: Minikube (running)
- **Container Runtime**: Docker Desktop
- **Go Version**: 1.24-alpine (from Dockerfile)

## Test Objectives
1. Verify the CRD field validation fix resolves "unknown field" warnings
2. Ensure the operator builds and runs correctly with the updated CRDs
3. Validate the installation process works with the new CRD structure
4. Confirm no regression in operator functionality

## Test Results Summary
✅ **All tests passed successfully**

## Detailed Test Steps and Results

### 1. Code Compilation
```bash
./scripts/make.sh build
```
**Result**: ✅ Binary built successfully

### 2. Docker Image Build
```bash
./scripts/make.sh docker
```
**Result**: ✅ Docker image built successfully
- Image: `right-sizer:latest`
- Build time: 36.3s
- All 21 build steps completed without errors

### 3. Minikube Deployment

#### 3.1 Load Image to Minikube
```bash
minikube image load right-sizer:latest
```
**Result**: ✅ Image loaded successfully

#### 3.2 Install CRDs
```bash
./scripts/install-crds.sh
```
**Result**: ✅ CRDs installed successfully
- `rightsizerconfigs.rightsizer.io` - Created with full schema
- `rightsizerpolicies.rightsizer.io` - Created with full schema
- Both CRDs established and verified
- Short names confirmed: `rsc` and `rsp`

#### 3.3 Deploy Operator with Helm
```bash
helm install right-sizer ./helm \
  --namespace right-sizer-system \
  --create-namespace \
  --set image.repository=right-sizer \
  --set image.tag=latest \
  --set image.pullPolicy=Never
```
**Result**: ✅ Deployment successful
- Namespace: `right-sizer-system`
- Status: Deployed
- Pod Status: Running (1/1 READY)

### 4. Validation Tests

#### 4.1 Check for "Unknown Field" Errors
```bash
kubectl logs -n right-sizer-system <pod-name> | grep -i "unknown field"
```
**Result**: ✅ No "unknown field" errors found
- Previous errors completely resolved
- Logs show clean operation

#### 4.2 Verify CRD Field Access
```bash
kubectl explain rightsizerconfig.spec.defaultResourceStrategy
kubectl explain rightsizerconfig.spec.globalConstraints
```
**Result**: ✅ Fields properly accessible
- All fields that previously showed as "unknown" are now properly defined
- kubectl explain returns correct field documentation

#### 4.3 Operator Functionality Test
**Observations from logs:**
- ✅ Metrics server started successfully on port 9090
- ✅ In-place pod resizing working (resized the operator pod itself)
- ✅ RightSizerConfig reconciliation successful
- ✅ Configuration applied from CRD
- ✅ Audit logging enabled
- ✅ System metrics updated

#### 4.4 CRD Resources Check
```bash
kubectl get rightsizerconfigs,rightsizerpolicies -A
```
**Result**: ✅ Default configuration created and active
- RightSizerConfig "default" - Status: Active
- Mode: balanced
- Interval: 30s

### 5. Test Deployment
```bash
kubectl apply -f tests/fixtures/test-deployment.yaml
```
**Result**: ✅ Test deployment configured successfully

## Issues Encountered and Resolved

### Issue 1: CRD Scope Conflict
- **Problem**: Existing CRDs had different scope (Cluster vs Namespaced)
- **Solution**: Deleted old CRDs and reinstalled with correct definitions
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved

### Issue 2: Helm Release Conflict
- **Problem**: Previous Helm release in different namespace
- **Solution**: Uninstalled old release and reinstalled in correct namespace
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved

## Performance Observations
- Operator startup time: ~5 seconds to become ready
- CRD establishment time: < 2 seconds
- First reconciliation: Immediate after startup
- Resource adjustment detection: Working correctly

## Regression Testing
No regressions observed. All existing functionality remains intact:
- ✅ Pod resource resizing
- ✅ In-place resize capability
- ✅ Metrics collection
- ✅ CRD reconciliation
- ✅ Audit logging

## Files Changed Summary
- **Removed**: 3 simplified CRD files causing validation issues
- **Updated**: 7 files (scripts, documentation, controllers)
- **Added**: 2 new files (fix script, troubleshooting guide)

## Recommendations
1. **For existing users**: Run `./scripts/fix-crd-fields.sh` to update CRDs
2. **For new installations**: Use the updated `install-crds.sh` script
3. **Documentation**: Refer to `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING_CRD_FIELDS.md` for detailed information

## Conclusion
The CRD field validation fix has been successfully implemented and tested. The "unknown field" warnings have been completely eliminated, and the operator continues to function correctly with improved field validation and schema documentation.

## Test Artifacts
- Git commit: `fcb0272`
- Docker image: `right-sizer:latest`
- Test cluster: Minikube
- Logs: Clean, no errors or warnings related to field validation

## Sign-off
✅ Ready for production deployment
