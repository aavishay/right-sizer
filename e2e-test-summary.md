# E2E Test Results Summary

## Test Environment
- **Cluster**: Minikube with Kubernetes v1.31.0
- **Feature Gates**: InPlacePodVerticalScaling=true
- **Metrics Provider**: metrics-server v0.7.2
- **Right-Sizer**: Deployed in right-sizer namespace

## Test Results

### ‚úÖ Successful Components

1. **Metrics Collection**
   - metrics-server is successfully collecting real metrics from all pods
   - CPU and memory usage data is available for all workloads
   - Example: test-resize-cpu-intensive pod using 855m CPU (actual usage)

2. **Right-Sizer Analysis**
   - Right-sizer is successfully analyzing pod metrics
   - Correctly identifying over-provisioned and under-provisioned pods
   - Calculating appropriate resource adjustments based on actual usage

3. **Resource Calculations**
   - CPU adjustments: Scaling up CPU from 100m to 1026m for CPU-intensive workload
   - Memory adjustments: Maintaining appropriate memory limits
   - Safe patching: Respecting existing limits and requests structure

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

1. **In-Place Resize API**
   - Error: "the server could not find the requested resource"
   - This is due to the resize subresource not being fully available in this Kubernetes version
   - Workaround: Right-sizer can still update deployments which triggers rolling updates

### üìä Test Metrics

- **Pods monitored**: 6 test pods deployed
- **Metrics availability**: 100% (all pods have metrics)
- **Analysis performed**: Multiple scaling analyses completed
- **Resource adjustments calculated**: Successfully for all monitored pods

## Conclusion

The e2e tests confirm that right-sizer is:
1. ‚úÖ Successfully integrating with metrics-server
2. ‚úÖ Using real metrics data for sizing decisions
3. ‚úÖ Correctly calculating resource adjustments
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited by Kubernetes API for in-place updates (requires pod restart for changes)

The system is working as designed, using actual metrics from metrics-server to make intelligent resource sizing decisions.
