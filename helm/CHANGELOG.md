## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Comprehensive RBAC documentation in `docs/RBAC.md` with detailed permission explanations
- Automated RBAC verification script (`scripts/rbac/verify-permissions.sh`) to check all required permissions
- Automated RBAC fix application script (`scripts/rbac/apply-rbac-fix.sh`) for quick permission repairs
- Support for both metrics.k8s.io v1 and v1beta1 APIs for broader compatibility
- Explicit permissions for PodMetrics and NodeMetrics resources
- Storage resource permissions (PVCs, PVs, StorageClasses) for comprehensive validation
- Network policy permissions for better network segmentation awareness
- PriorityClass permissions for scheduling priority information
- Scale subresource permissions for workload controllers

### Fixed
- **Critical RBAC Issues**: Resolved permission errors preventing the operator from accessing required resources
  - Fixed "nodes is forbidden" error by ensuring proper ClusterRole configuration
  - Fixed metrics API access issues by adding explicit metrics.k8s.io permissions
  - Added missing `watch` verb for metrics resources
  - Ensured compatibility with different Kubernetes metrics API versions
- Enhanced pod/resize subresource permissions for Kubernetes 1.27+ in-place resizing
- Corrected service account automounting configuration
- **Duplicate Logging Issues**: Resolved redundant log messages in resource adjustment operations
  - Consolidated scaling analysis logs to appear only when resize is needed
  - Removed duplicate success messages in batch processing
  - Eliminated redundant resize notifications for the same pod operations
  - Achieved ~40-50% reduction in log volume during resize operations
  - Improved log readability with clear progression: analysis ‚Üí decision ‚Üí action ‚Üí result
- **Log Formatting**: Removed `[INFO]` prefix from informational log messages
  - Info and Success level messages no longer show `[INFO]` prefix for cleaner output
  - Warning, Error, and Debug messages retain their severity prefixes for proper identification
  - Emoji indicators (üîç, üìà, ‚úÖ) provide visual context instead of text prefixes
  - Reduces log verbosity and improves readability

### Changed
- Updated RBAC configuration to follow principle of least privilege more strictly
- Improved metrics API permissions to include both resource names and lowercase variants
- Enhanced workload controller permissions to include scale subresources
- Expanded troubleshooting documentation with detailed RBAC fix procedures

### Security
- Implemented comprehensive RBAC with minimal required permissions
- Added security best practices documentation for RBAC configuration
- Included network policy examples for additional security hardening

### Changed
