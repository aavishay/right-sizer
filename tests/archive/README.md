# Archived Test Files

This directory contains historical test reports, scripts, and configurations that are no longer actively used but are preserved for reference and historical context.

## Archived Test Reports

### Test Results Documentation
These files contain results from past test runs that have been completed:

- **`COMPREHENSIVE_TEST_RESULTS.md`** - Comprehensive test results from a previous testing cycle
- **`MEMORY_METRICS_TEST_RESULTS.md`** - Results from memory metrics feature testing
- **`TEST_REPORT.md`** - General test report from past testing
- **`scaling-thresholds-test-report.md`** - Test report for scaling threshold feature validation
- **`MEMORY_METRICS_TESTING.md`** - Documentation of memory metrics testing procedures

### Migration Documentation
- **`MIGRATION-SUMMARY.md`** - Summary of a past migration or upgrade process

### Test Scripts
These scripts were created for specific features that have been implemented and validated:

- **`memory-metrics-minikube-test.sh`** - Script for testing memory metrics on Minikube
- **`quick-memory-test.sh`** - Quick test script for memory functionality

### Test Configuration Files
Configuration files used for specific test scenarios:

- **`simple-skip-test.yaml`** - Test configuration for skip logic validation
- **`skip-logic-test.yaml`** - Another configuration for testing skip functionality

## Why These Files Were Archived

1. **Completed Features**: Test files for features that have been fully implemented and are now part of the standard test suite
2. **Historical Test Results**: Past test reports that document the state at a specific point in time
3. **Redundant Test Scripts**: Scripts that have been superseded by more comprehensive testing approaches
4. **One-time Test Configurations**: Test configs created for specific scenarios that are no longer needed

## Using Archived Tests

While these files are archived, they may still be valuable for:
- Understanding how specific features were tested during development
- Referencing test approaches for similar future features
- Historical comparison of test results
- Debugging issues that might relate to previously tested scenarios
