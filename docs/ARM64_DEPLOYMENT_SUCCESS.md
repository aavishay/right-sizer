# ✅ Right-Sizer ARM64 Deployment Success Guide

## Successfully Deployed on ARM64 (Apple Silicon / ARM-based Systems)

This document summarizes the successful deployment of Right-Sizer on ARM64 architecture, specifically addressing the "exec format error" issue and providing a working solution.

## Problem Solved

The initial deployment failed with:
```
exec /usr/local/bin/right-sizer: exec format error
```

This error occurred because the Docker image was built for the wrong architecture. Multi-platform builds with buildx were not properly loading the correct architecture in Minikube.

## Solution

A dedicated ARM64 build process that ensures the binary is compiled specifically for ARM64 architecture.

### Key Changes Made

1. **Go Version**: Updated to Go 1.25 across all components
2. **Architecture-Specific Build**: Created dedicated ARM64 build process
3. **Proper GOARCH Setting**: Explicitly set `GOARCH=arm64` during compilation
4. **Direct Docker Build**: Used standard Docker build instead of buildx for Minikube compatibility

## Deployment Script

The `deploy-arm64.sh` script successfully deploys Right-Sizer on ARM64 systems:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
./deploy-arm64.sh
```

### What the Script Does

1. **Verifies Architecture**: Checks that both host and Minikube are ARM64
2. **Builds ARM64 Binary**: Compiles Go binary specifically for ARM64
3. **Creates Docker Image**: Builds image using Minikube's Docker daemon
4. **Deploys with Helm**: Installs Right-Sizer using the ARM64 image
5. **Verifies Deployment**: Confirms pod is running without errors

## Successful Deployment Output

## Current Status

### ✅ Working Components

- **Right-Sizer Operator**: Running successfully on ARM64
- **Metrics Server**: Operational at port 9090
- **API Server**: Running on port 8082
- **Health Checks**: All passing
- **Test Workloads**: Deployed and being monitored
- **Helm Chart**: Successfully installed with ARM64 image

### 📊 Active Monitoring

The operator is actively monitoring workloads:
```
2025/09/24 20:39:58 ✅ Rightsizing run completed in 1.087083ms
2025/09/24 20:40:28 ✅ Rightsizing run completed in 302.75µs
```

## Quick Commands

### View Logs
```bash
kubectl logs -n right-sizer -l app.kubernetes.io/name=right-sizer -f
```

### Port Forward for Metrics
```bash
kubectl port-forward -n right-sizer svc/right-sizer 9090:9090
```

### Check Metrics
```bash
curl http://localhost:9090/metrics
```

### Monitor Test Workloads
```bash
kubectl get pods -n test-workloads -w
```

### Check Resource Usage
```bash
kubectl top pods -n test-workloads
```

## Test Workloads Deployed

Three test deployments are running:
1. **nginx-demo**: 3 replicas with standard web server
2. **redis-cache**: 1 replica Redis instance
3. **Services**: LoadBalancer for nginx, ClusterIP for Redis

All pods are running successfully and being monitored by Right-Sizer.

## Technical Details

### Docker Image Specifications
- **Base Image**: `golang:1.25-alpine` (build stage)
- **Runtime Image**: `gcr.io/distroless/static-debian12:nonroot`
- **Architecture**: ARM64/AARCH64
- **Size**: ~35.9MB
- **Go Version**: 1.25
- **CGO**: Disabled for static binary

### Build Configuration
```dockerfile
ENV CGO_ENABLED=0
ENV GOOS=linux
ENV GOARCH=arm64
```

### Helm Values Used
```yaml
image:
  repository: right-sizer
  tag: arm64
  pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: 100m
    memory: 128Mi
  limits:
    cpu: 500m
    memory: 512Mi
```

## Troubleshooting ARM64 Issues

### If You Encounter Architecture Errors

1. **Verify System Architecture**:
   ```bash
   uname -m  # Should show arm64 or aarch64
   ```

2. **Check Minikube Architecture**:
   ```bash
   minikube ssh -- uname -m  # Should show aarch64
   ```

3. **Verify Docker Image Architecture**:
   ```bash
   docker inspect right-sizer:arm64 | grep Architecture
   ```

4. **Rebuild if Necessary**:
   ```bash
   ./deploy-arm64.sh  # This script handles ARM64 properly
   ```

### Common ARM64 Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| exec format error | Use ARM64-specific build script |
| Image pull errors | Build locally instead of pulling |
| buildx compatibility | Use standard Docker build for Minikube |
| Performance issues | Adjust resource limits for ARM64 |

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Resource Usage**: Watch how Right-Sizer optimizes the test workloads
2. **Configure Policies**: Create custom resizing policies for your workloads
3. **Enable Dashboard**: Deploy the Right-Sizer dashboard for visualization
4. **Production Deployment**: Use this configuration as a template for production ARM64 clusters

## Summary

The Right-Sizer operator is now successfully running on ARM64 architecture in Minikube. The deployment is stable, monitoring is active, and all components are functioning correctly. The solution can be used as a reference for deploying on other ARM64 Kubernetes clusters, including production environments on AWS Graviton, Azure ARM instances, or on-premise ARM servers.
