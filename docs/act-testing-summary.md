## Test Results Summary

| Workflow | Dry-Run | Full Test | Status | Notes |
|----------|---------|-----------|---------|-------|
| test.yml | ‚úÖ Pass | ‚úÖ Ready | Validated | Safe for full execution |
| helm.yml | ‚úÖ Pass | ‚úÖ Ready | Validated | Helm lint and template working |
| docker.yml | ‚úÖ Pass | ‚ö†Ô∏è Dry-run only | Validated | Prevents registry pushes |
| release.yml | ‚úÖ Pass | üîÑ Partial | Validated | Individual jobs tested |

## Security & Safety Measures

### ‚úÖ Credential Management
- **Test credentials only** in `.env.act` file
- **No real secrets** committed to repository
- **Registry push prevention** in Docker workflows
- **Isolated testing environment** using act containers

### ‚úÖ Resource Protection
- **Artifact isolation** using `/tmp/artifacts` path
- **Container cleanup** procedures established
- **Network isolation** where appropriate
- **Dry-run first policy** for destructive operations

## Usage Instructions

### Quick Start
```bash
# Setup and validate
./scripts/test-github-actions.sh setup
./scripts/test-github-actions.sh local

# Test specific workflow
./scripts/test-github-actions.sh helm
```

### Manual Testing
```bash
# List all workflows
act -l

# Test specific job
act -j test -W .github/workflows/test.yml --dryrun
act -j test -W .github/workflows/test.yml
```

### Development Workflow
1. **Local validation first**: `./scripts/test-github-actions.sh local`
2. **Dry-run validation**: `act -j <job> --dryrun`
3. **Full testing**: Selected workflows based on changes
4. **Pre-commit check**: Always run local validation

## Performance Metrics

### Container Efficiency
- **Base image**: catthehacker/ubuntu:act-latest
- **Platform**: linux/amd64 (M-series compatible)
- **Caching**: Enabled for repeated runs
- **Resource usage**: Optimized for local development

### Testing Speed
- **Local validation**: ~30 seconds (no containers)
- **Dry-run validation**: ~1-2 minutes (setup + validation)
- **Full workflow test**: ~3-5 minutes (including downloads)
- **Cached runs**: Significantly faster after initial setup

## Integration Points

### ‚úÖ Pre-commit Hooks
- Local validation can be integrated into git hooks
- Fast feedback loop for developers
- Prevents broken workflows from reaching CI

### ‚úÖ Pull Request Validation
- Targeted testing based on file changes
- Workflow-specific validation strategies
- Comprehensive testing for release candidates

### ‚úÖ CI/CD Pipeline
